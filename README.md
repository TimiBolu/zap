# Zio
Zig library which acts as a runtime for asynchronous computing and IO.
Zio aims to efficiently implement a concurrent processing and IO system on a per-platform basis; currently aiming to support x86 & ARM along with Windows, Linux and other *BSD based Systems (including Mac OSX).

While Zio's main focus is concurrent IO, it also provides OS abstractions either not found or less restricting that those in the standard libraray as of zig 0.4.0. This project is still a WIP and there is no documentation yet.
