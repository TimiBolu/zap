# Zio
Zig library which acts as a runtime for asynchronous computing and IO.
Zio aims to efficiently implement a concurrent processing and IO system on a per-platform basis; currently aiming to support x86 & ARM along with Windows, Linux and other *BSD based Systems (including Mac OSX).

This project is still a WIP and there is no documentation yet.
